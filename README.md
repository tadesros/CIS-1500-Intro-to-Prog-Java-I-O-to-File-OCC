# CIS-Java-Week-Week-10
File I/o



Please have your initial post in by Sunday 7/17 11:59pm and a reply to a classmate in by Tuesday 7/19 11:59pm

For your initial post, please write a program that will create a file named something like ericswishlist.txt and writes at least 5 items that you wish for ( you can hard code them in or ask the user to enter them ), 1 per line.

so after running the program, I would have a file named ericswishlist.txt with the contents of:

3d printer

espresso maker

running shoes

whole bean coffee

f150 lightning


For your reply to a classmate, please write a program that reads the file they created ( be sure to use the right file name ), randomly picks one of the items on the list and outputs "Java has a good feeling you'll get (item name here) soon!"
